# canvas-scrollbars

I noticed that there was no scrollbar for a tkinter canvas and after the widget proved to be a nuisance to position i decided to create my own. I got a bit carried away, but i hope this will be of use to someone!

Horizontal and vertical scrollbars designed for the canvases - specifically, the tkinter library of Python 3.5. However, if the tkinter specific commands were changed it could easily be used for other canvas based objects as the theory behind the GUI is the same. I tried to make it ultra-customisable!
